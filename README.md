# Project Title: Vitarana Drone

# Introduction: 
At present we all were in the Generation where each and every door delivery is given by a Man. So to make a step ahead for Future towards the Technology, I would like to introduce our Project “Vitarana Drone– Make a Step ahead for Future”. In this project, I would like to make a drone which works flies according to the QR-Code's Data and deliver the product at customer prescribed address. In this project, we will embed a software which navigates the Drone to Customer’s address with the scanned QR-Code on the box.


# Limitations:

Needs Accurate GPS access


# Advantages/Features:

Fast & Secure Delivery
Able to deliver the product in any Environmental Conditions


# Technologies:

ROS (Robot Operating System)
Path Planning
Artificial Intelligence
Drone technology


# Tools:

ROS: To perform internal computing, path planning and internal communication within drone with Python Language
Programming Languages: Developing Artificial Intelligence to receive the commands and work accordingly
Drone: To deliver the product.


# Application:
It can be used any Field like:

Military: To transfer the weapons or messages secretly
Medical: To transfer any medicine Urgently
Business: Delivering the Products securely & very fast


# Conclusion:
Hence it was the new concept of Dronmakehich can make a change in the field of technology. In the future, these drones can help in receiving information from customers. Not only that in the future, these drones can help in receiving the weather information too. In the future, we can also develop this project more and more securely like authorizing the person by Bio-Metric or by Face Recognition etc..
